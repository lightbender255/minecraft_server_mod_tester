# Minecraft Server Mod Tester

## What is this?

This application tests mod compatibility by uploading them one by one to the server, starting the server and then checking if the server successfully started.

For now, it uses ftp and the Nodecraft API. I'll add more hosts when I have time to... Which probably means never. It's unlikely I'll even finish this application.

## Why Rust?

I was curious.

## Hey! There is a way easier obvious way to do this!

If there is, please let me know. I often miss completely obvious things and then over-engineer a solution.
